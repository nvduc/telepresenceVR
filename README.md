# Telepresence System for Remote Participant

## Overview

![Alt text](telepresence_system.png?raw=true "System Architecture")

The system allows remote users to participate in live events (football matches, concerts) from their homes as if they were in the real places.
360 video/audio captured from a 360 camera located at the remote site are streamed to the user's location using ``WebRTC protocol``, which are watched by users using VR Headsets. The user can interact with people in the remote site using his/her voice. When testing in local networks, the one-way delay of the system is approximately 0.3-0.5 sec for 2K video at 30fps.
